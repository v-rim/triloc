cam
    sets up video sources
    applies preprocessing
    returns processed frames

detect
    takes frames
    returns angles of detected objects relative to the camera center
    may need a way to manually detect focal length

triangulation
    given angles of detected objects
    returns 3D coordinates
    can improve by calculating coordinates ahead of time

predict
    given 3D coordinates
    returns 3D velocity
        Assumes motion can be modeled with quadratic

Assigning cameras
    One of the issues with OpenCV video streams is that the order of the streams
    can change depending on the order that the cameras are plugged in. However,
    once all the cameras are plugged in it should be constant. There needs to be
    a way to assign the correct video streams to the right positions.
